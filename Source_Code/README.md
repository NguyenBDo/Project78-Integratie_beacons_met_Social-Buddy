# Source Code

Here lies the code that were used during
the project.

Everything within the `./tests` directory
were used to conduct research or tests.

The others are a part of the main code.
As per Jack's request, the whole code
base would not be in this Github
respsotory. Only the parts that we
have worked on will be here.
