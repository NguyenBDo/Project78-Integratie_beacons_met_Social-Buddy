`FYI` a directory is a folder.

There are elderlies all over the world that feel isolated at home, 
especially those with disabilities. Jack Jagt wants to help these people, 
and as a result he has started `Social Buddy'. 
He and his team has made applications that help caregivers with their jobs and the elderly with their lives. 
Besides developing the software with his team, 
he has also taken an interest in the skills of the students of
Rotterdam University of Applied Science (Hogeschool Rotterdam).
Therefore Jack Jagt has assigned us a project to work with.
    
As a group have been tasked to integrate the Flic button 
and a location tracking tag with the current Buddy Bot application.

In this repository, you can find the source code of the Flic button and the tag; 
and the documentation concerning the whole project. 
Please look at the correct directory when searching for something.
